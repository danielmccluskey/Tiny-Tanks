# README #

This repo is to contain my submission for the second assignment of CT4019.

I will be recreating Wii Tanks using the UoG Framework.

# Permissions#
Permission to view the repos will be given to the following on submission on assumption that these are the people marking the assignments since no information was given:

•	Jamie Stewart (JStewart2)

•	William Sayers (Snikts)

•	Will Masek (wmasek)


# Custom Levels #
You can add your own levels by adding a text file at "./resources/maps/" called "lvl_X.txt" with X being the level number. E.g. ("lvl_10.txt")
However there is no validation for the files as of yet so putting in a txt file that does not follow the format of the others will break the game.
The game will continue until there are no more text files.
